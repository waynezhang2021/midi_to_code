# midi_to_code
Convert MIDI files to C++ programs that play the music when run.
midi_to_code.exe generates a C++ program that dynamically synthesizes the music when run.
midi_to_pcm.exe generates a C++ program that statically plays the generated music array when run.(not very practical)
midi_to_csv.py generates a CSV file from a MIDI file for the previous 2 programs.
